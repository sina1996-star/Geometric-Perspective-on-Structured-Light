# Geometric-Perspective-on-Structured-Light
The encoding and decoding process of Hamiltonian Steuctured Light Patterns are implemented in MATLAB. 
The main mfile to be runned is Corrrespondence_Calculation.m . Other m.files will be used inside it. The explanations of each functioin is written inside the mfiles. 

Also, there are several images which include the Hamiltonina Patterns of order 5, the suggested patterns and the images captured by the camera that are used in the codes. The .mat files include the parameters of the calibrated camera and projector.
