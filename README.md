# Geometric-Perspective-on-Structured-Light
The encoding and decoding process of Hamiltonian Structured Light Patterns are implemented in MATLAB. 
The main mfile to be runned is Corrrespondence_Calculation.m . Other m.files will be used inside it. The explanations of each functioin is written inside the mfiles. After running the code, a point cloud of the surface will be created in a new folder named _output. The point cloud has a .ply format and can be visualized either in MATALB or MeshLab softwares. 

Also, there are several images which include Hamiltonian Patterns of order 5, the suggested patterns and the images captured by the camera. The .mat files include the parameters of the calibrated camera and projector.
